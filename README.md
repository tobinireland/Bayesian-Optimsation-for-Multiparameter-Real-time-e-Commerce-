# Bayesian Optimisation for Multiparameter Real-time e-Commerce

**Author:** Your Name  
**Course:** Imperial College — Capstone Project  

---

## 📘 Overview
This project explores how Bayesian optimisation can improve multi-parameter tuning for real-time e-commerce environments.

The goal is to use real retail datasets and demonstrate how Bayesian optimisation can enhance decision-making in areas like pricing, inventory, and timing.
